####1. How do I add a text for editing?
1. Go to the eXist-db Package Manager. 
2. Click on the three dots at the top right of the screen and select 'Show Libraries'.  (If it says 'Hide Libraries', then you're already showing them and don't need to do anything.)
3. Click on the 'Available' pane. You'll see OCR output and images. 
4. Click on the download icon of  the OCR output you want to edit. Patiently wait for it to install in about 5 minutes. (The corresponding images will be downloaded as well if you don't yet have them.)
5. Click on the Lace application packge, and you should see your text added.

####2. How do I back up my work? 
Everything you do is saved to the exist database as you do it. There's no need to save data regularly. However, occasionally a database can become corrupted. You can save your progress with a given volume thus:

1. Click on 'Lace' at the top left of the screen
2. Click on the name of the volume you want to back up.
3. Here you'll see a list of perhaps more than one 'run' for this volume. Find the one you've been working on. (It probably has the greatest percentage of edited words.) 
4. Then, with its 'Download' menu, select 'Download XAR File'. 

The resulting XAR file is a complete backup of everything that's been done with that run, and can be installed in Lace with the Package Manager if the worst happens. 

Alternatively, you can back up the entire eXist-db 'data' directory. Its location is OS-dependent.

####3. How do I delete all that I've done on a volume and start fresh?

The database tries to hold on to data as much as possible, so first you need to delete the package before reinstalling the unedited version. 

1. Go to the Package Manager.
2. Click on the three dots at the top right of the screen and select 'Show Libraries'. (If it says 'Hide Libraries', then you're already showing them and don't need to do anything.)
3. Click on the 'Installed' pane.
4. Find the volume you want to delete, and click on its garbage can icon. This will permanently delete all your work.
5. Go to the 'Available' tab and install the package again by clicking on its 'install' icon.
6. Click on the Lace application packge in the 'Installed' pane, and you should see your text.
